### Purpose/Objective

- Goal: Improve cognitive workload detection by combining EEG and pupillometry
- Research Questions:
  1. Does a multimodal system outperform single-modality systems in cognitive workload detection?
  2. What are the strengths and limitations of integrating EEG and pupillometry?

### Methodology

- Participants: 23 individuals aged 15–48
- Task: Mental arithmetic tasks to induce cognitive workload versus a no-task control condition
- Data Collection:
  - EEG signals recorded with a Biosemi ActiveTwo system (32 electrodes)
  - Pupil diameter measured using a Tobii X2-30 eye tracker
  - Data analyzed using common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithms and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

### Main Results/Findings

- Metrics:
  - EEG + pupillometry: Classification error rate of 17%
  - EEG only: Error rate of 24.1%
  - Pupillometry only: Error rate of 26.1%
- Signal Quality:
  - EEG captures subtle neural oscillations but is susceptible to artifacts
  - Pupillometry is simpler but influenced by ambient light and brightness

### Limitations

- Ambient light variations can interfere with pupil measurements
- Short task duration may have limited EEG signal discrimination

### Proposed Future Work

- Explore multimodal approaches in diverse cognitive tasks
- Develop methods to account for light changes in pupillometry
