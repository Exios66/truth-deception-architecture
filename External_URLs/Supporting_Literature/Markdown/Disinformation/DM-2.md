## Key Quotes

1. "Citizens may be simultaneously too gullible and too vigilant, which paradoxically amplifies their susceptibility to misinformation."
2. "Meta-cognitive myopia renders individuals sensitive to readily available information while resisting cues about its credibility."
3. "The illusory truth effect demonstrates that repeated exposure to misinformation can increase its perceived validity, regardless of its accuracy."
4. "Modern information environments exacerbate cognitive biases, undermining the ability to discern credible information."

## Questions and Answers

1. **What is epistemic vigilance?**
   Cognitive mechanisms that protect individuals from misinformation, driven by context, trust, and reasoning.
2. **How does cognitive overload affect misinformation resistance?**
   It impairs critical evaluation, increasing susceptibility to false information.
3. **What role does repetition play in misinformation spread?**
   The illusory truth effect shows repeated exposure enhances perceived truthfulness.
4. **Why is misinformation challenging to counteract?**
   Cognitive biases like confirmation bias and truth bias make false information stick.

## Methodology and Findings

### Psychological Phenomena Reviewed

- **Gullibility**:
  - Meta-cognitive myopia limits critical assessment of information sources.
  - Truth bias makes individuals prone to believe linguistic inputs by default.
- **Vigilance**:
  - Mistrust triggers alternative information processing but is inconsistent.
  - Critical evaluation often fails against repeated or contextually embedded misinformation.

### Information Ecosystem Challenges

- **Algorithmic Amplification**: Social media platforms prioritize sensational content, fostering misinformation spread.
- **Cognitive Demands**: Overwhelming information volumes reduce citizens' capacity for discerning truth.
