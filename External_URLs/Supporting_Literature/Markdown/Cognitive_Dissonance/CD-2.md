* **Journal/Source**: Honors Research Thesis, The Ohio State University
* **Publication Year**: April 2017
* **DOI/URL**: Not provided
* **Affiliation**: Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University

## Audience

* **Target Audience**: Psychologists, cognitive scientists, behavioral economists, and educators
* **Application**: Investigating decision-making mechanisms and developing strategies to mitigate decision-related discomfort
* **Outcome**: Enhanced understanding of cognitive dissonance and its effects on post-decision attitude adjustment

## Relevance

* **Significance**: The study revisits cognitive dissonance theory, providing insights into its validity and exploring critiques by Bem (1967) and Chen & Risen (2010)
* **Real-world Implications**: Findings can inform strategies to alleviate decision-related discomfort in education, therapy, and consumer behavior

## Conclusions

### Key Takeaways

1. Spreading of alternatives was observed across both positive and negative decision contexts
2. Post-choice discomfort did not consistently predict the spreading of alternatives, raising questions about the centrality of dissonance in this phenomenon
3. Discomfort patterns and decision valence suggest nuanced mechanisms beyond traditional dissonance explanations

* **Practical Implications**: The results suggest possible roles for alternative mechanisms like self-perception in post-decision attitude adjustments
* **Potential Impact**: May refine theoretical frameworks and methodologies for studying decision-making and cognitive discomfort

## Abstract Summary

### In a Nutshell

The study evaluates cognitive dissonance and its role in spreading alternatives by examining choices between equally liked or disliked options. Results reveal spreading occurs but challenge the consistent link between discomfort and dissonance-based theories.

### Keywords

* Cognitive Dissonance
* Spreading of Alternatives
* Decision-Making
* Self-Perception Theory
* Discomfort in Choices

### Gap/Need

Addresses whether post-choice attitude changes are due to dissonance or other mechanisms such as self-perception.

### Innovation

Incorporates choice valence (positive vs. negative options) to investigate spreading dynamics and evaluates discomfort's predictive power in this process.

## Key Quotes

1. "Post-choice spreading was observed for both positive and negative options, but discomfort was not a consistent predictor"
2. "Discomfort-driven spreading aligns with dissonance theory in negative decisions but not universally"
3. "Findings support dissonance theory partially but highlight alternative explanations like self-perception"

## Questions and Answers

1. Does discomfort predict spreading of alternatives? Not consistently; its influence varies by context and choice valence
2. What role does choice valence play? Valence moderates spreading, with distinct dynamics for positive and negative options
3. Are alternative theories like self-perception validated? The results provide partial support for self-perception in decision-related attitude changes

## Paper Details

### Purpose/Objective

* **Goal**: Examine the role of cognitive dissonance and discomfort in the spreading of alternatives
* **Research Questions**:
  1. Is discomfort central to post-decision spreading?
  2. Does choice valence impact dissonance and spreading dynamics?

### Methodology

* **Research Design**: Experimental study with pre-choice and post-choice evaluations of food items
* **Participants**: 111 individuals, ages 18-34, predominantly female, recruited via Ohio State's Research Experience Program
* **Tools**: Pre- and post-choice ratings on a semantic differential scale; composite measures for discomfort
* **Data Analysis**: T-tests and regression analyses assessed the relationships between choice valence, discomfort, and spreading

### Main Results/Findings

* **Metrics**:
  * Spreading of Alternatives: Significant across both conditions but not consistently driven by discomfort
  * Discomfort: Higher for negative choices but inconsistently related to spreading dynamics
* **Data Availability**: No external dataset provided

### Limitations

* Small sample size and limited diversity in food choices constrain generalizability
* Discomfort measures may inadequately capture the specific nuances of choice-induced dissonance

### Proposed Future Work

* Develop more precise measures of discomfort tailored to choice paradigms
* Explore alternative mechanisms like self-perception and their interaction with cognitive dissonance

## Expert Commentary

* **Critiques**: Discomfort measures could be refined, and the study's small sample size may reduce the reliability of nuanced conclusions
* **Praise**: Novel integration of choice valence and discomfort provides fresh insights into cognitive dissonance theory
* **Questions**: How do findings generalize across other types of decisions or cultural contexts? Could longer-term studies reveal different dynamics of spreading?
