### Gap/Need

Traditional methods emphasize performance without understanding the underlying nature of emergent communication structures. This study fills this gap by focusing on internal representation dynamics and their impact on communication efficacy.

### Innovation

Combines RL, sparse autoencoders, and feedback mechanisms to explore emergent language, generalization, and efficiency in a computational setting.

### Key Quotes

1.	“The feedback changes the lower-dimensional task representations so that the student obtains more information on where to go, rather than the actual composition of the state space.”
2.	“Adding student feedback into the message structure creates a natural evolution of language.”
3.	“Our study highlights the role of reward-driven communication in creating efficient and generalizable message systems.”

#### Paper Details

Purpose/Objective Goal: Analyze emergent communication systems in social learning agents and optimize their performance via feedback-driven learning.
	•	Research Questions:
	1.	How does feedback shape emergent languages in multi-agent systems?
	2.	Can sparse, low-dimensional communication improve generalization in unseen tasks?

Methodology
	•	System Design: Teacher-student RL framework with sparse autoencoders to generate low-dimensional messages.
	•	Tasks: Navigation in grid-world mazes.
	•	Data Analysis:
	•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of message embeddings.
	•	Variance analysis of message structures with and without feedback.

Main Results/Findings
	•	Metrics:
	•	Feedback increases task completion rates by ~20%.
	•	Low-dimensional message spaces emerge with hierarchical structures representing task variables like goal location and path policy.
	•	Generalization: Agents trained with feedback generalize better to unseen tasks compared to those trained without it.

Limitations
	•	Limited task complexity (e.g., grid-worlds) may constrain broader applicability.

Proposed Future Work
	•	Extend to more complex, real-world tasks.
	•	Incorporate sequential compositionality to better mimic human language structures.
