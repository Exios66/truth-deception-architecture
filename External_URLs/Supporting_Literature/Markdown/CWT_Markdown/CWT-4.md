## Research Focus

This study examines the effects of high cognitive load situations (HCLS) on walking speed and cognitive complexity across different age groups. HCLS are defined as dual-task scenarios, such as walking while conversing on a phone.

## Methodology

- **Participants**: 36 individuals, divided into:
  - Young adults (average age: 23 years)
  - Middle-aged adults (average age: 44.8 years)
  - Older adults (average age: 74.5 years)
- **Tasks**: Participants engaged in:
  - Single-task walking (ST-W)
  - Single-task phone conversations (ST-C) on common or uncommon topics.
  - Dual-task walking while conversing on a phone (HCLS-C and HCLS-U).
- **Measures**: Walking speed, cognitive complexity (e.g., tone and use of complex words), and perceived stress were analyzed.

## Key Findings

1. **Walking Speed**:
   - HCLS significantly reduced walking speed compared to single-task walking.
   - Older adults walked slower across all conditions compared to younger adults.
2. **Cognitive Complexity**:
   - Conversations on uncommon topics reduced positive tone and use of complex words.
   - Age was negatively associated with cognitive complexity, with older adults showing simpler cognitive responses.
3. **Interactions**:
   - High cognitive load had a varying impact on tone and complexity depending on age.

## Implications

- **Practical Insights**: The findings highlight challenges older adults face in managing dual-tasks, emphasizing the need for interventions to improve multitasking capabilities in aging populations.
- **Applications**: Could inform the design of safer environments or assistive technologies for older adults to navigate complex tasks.
