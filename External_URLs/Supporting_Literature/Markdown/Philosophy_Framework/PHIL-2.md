• DOI/URL: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221617
• Affiliation: Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Ghent University, and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin

## Audience

• Target Audience: Philosophers, cognitive scientists, cultural psychologists, and researchers in consciousness and social behavior.
• Application: Exploring the relationship between free will beliefs (FWB), dualism, and determinism across cultural contexts.
• Outcome: Improved understanding of how lay beliefs about free will are influenced by cultural factors and their implications for social systems like justice.

## Relevance

• Significance: Shifts the focus from determinism’s influence on free will beliefs to dualism, revealing that beliefs in a non-physical mind are central to free will beliefs across cultures.
• Real-world Implications: Highlights the potential impact of dualism beliefs on attitudes toward responsibility, justice, and behavior in collectivist versus individualist societies.

## Conclusions

- Takeaways:

1. Dualism predicts free will beliefs more strongly than determinism across diverse cultures.
2. Lay beliefs about free will are logically inconsistent but culturally robust, showing significant reliance on dualistic notions.
3. Determinism beliefs vary between individualistic (e.g., the US) and collectivist cultures (e.g., Singapore), yet free will beliefs remain consistent.
4. Practical Implications: Calls for integrating dualistic beliefs into philosophical and empirical discussions on free will and responsibility.
5. Potential Impact: May influence the design of social interventions, including education, justice systems, and cross-cultural policies.

## Contextual Insight

### Abstract in a Nutshell

This cross-cultural study examines free will beliefs (FWB) in the United States and Singapore, using a large representative sample. It finds that dualism—not determinism—is the strongest predictor of FWB. The study highlights how FWB interact with cultural orientations like individualism and collectivism.

#### Abstract Keywords

-Free Will Beliefs

- Dualism
- Determinism
- Cultural Psychology
- Responsibility

### Gap/Need

Investigates free will beliefs beyond academic debates, addressing their cultural variations and dualism’s role, which is often overlooked.

### Innovation

Compares the contributions of dualism, determinism, and cultural context to free will beliefs using large, diverse samples and rigorous statistical modeling.

### Key Quotes

1. “Believing in free will goes hand-in-hand with a belief in a non-physical mind.”
2. “The relation of free will to dualism is stronger and more consistent than to determinism.”
3. “Cross-cultural differences in determinism beliefs emerge without affecting general free will beliefs.”

### Questions and Answers

1. What is the strongest predictor of free will beliefs?
   - Dualism, or the belief in a non-physical mind

2. How do cultures differ in free will beliefs?
   - Belief in free will is consistent, but determinism beliefs differ, with higher acceptance in collectivist cultures like Singapore

3. What does this imply about responsibility?

- Responsibility may be viewed differently in cultures emphasizing dualism versus determinism, affecting justice and social norms.

## Paper Details

### Purpose/Objective

- Goal: Identify whether dualism or determinism better predicts free will beliefs across individualist and collectivist cultures.

#### Research Questions

 1. How do dualism and determinism beliefs correlate with free will beliefs?
 2. Do these relationships differ across cultural contexts?

Methodology
 • Participants: 1,800 adults (900 each in the US and Singapore).
 • Tools: Free Will Inventory (FWI), measuring general free will beliefs, determinism, and dualism.
 • Data Analysis: Bayesian and frequentist models comparing cultural and individual-level variables.

Main Results/Findings
 • Metrics:
 • Strong correlation between free will beliefs and dualism (25% explained variance in Singapore).
 • Determinism had weaker, culturally variable correlations.
 • Cross-Cultural Consistency:
 • Free will beliefs were stable across cultures despite differences in determinism.

Limitations
 • Study focused only on two countries; findings may not generalize globally.
 • Did not experimentally manipulate cultural or belief variables.

Proposed Future Work
 • Expand to other cultures and belief systems.
 • Explore how dualism influences moral and legal judgments.

AutoExpert Insights and Commentary
 • Critiques: Future studies should integrate longitudinal designs to explore causal relationships between dualism and free will beliefs.
 • Praise: The cross-cultural, representative sampling strengthens the study’s conclusions and relevance.
 • Questions: How do educational and religious influences shape the relationship between dualism and free will beliefs? Could these findings inform debates on consciousness in neuroscience?
