	•	Affiliation: Marquette University, Philosophy Department

Audience
	•	Target Audience: Philosophers of mind, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and students exploring the nature of consciousness and subjective experience.
	•	Application: Reevaluating the “something-it-is-like” (SIL) concept of conscious experience through a holistic lens, influencing debates on qualia, the explanatory gap, and consciousness studies.
	•	Outcome: More robust frameworks for addressing the philosophical and empirical challenges posed by subjective experience.

Relevance
	•	Significance: Challenges traditional reductionist views of consciousness that treat subjective experiences as properties of mental states rather than holistic properties of entities.
	•	Real-world Implications: Influences discussions on the integration of empirical findings in neuroscience and cognitive science with philosophical theories about consciousness.

Conclusions
	•	Takeaways:
	1.	The “something-it-is-like” concept should be applied to entities holistically rather than reduced to states or qualia.
	2.	Reductionist approaches to qualia miss the relational, structural, and holistic aspects of subjective experience.
	3.	Holistic conceptions align more closely with empirical findings and avoid metaphysical dead-ends in the study of consciousness.
	•	Practical Implications: Provides a framework to reconcile philosophical inquiry with empirical research on consciousness, allowing for a more integrative approach.
	•	Potential Impact: Promotes a shift in consciousness studies towards holistic models and away from overly reductive interpretations.

Contextual Insight

Abstract in a Nutshell

The paper critiques the reduction of “something-it-is-like” (SIL) consciousness to state-level properties (qualia). It proposes a holistic alternative that treats SIL as a property of entities, enabling a richer dialogue between philosophy and empirical research.

Abstract Keywords
	•	Phenomenal Consciousness
	•	Qualia
	•	Explanatory Gap
	•	Holism
	•	Subjective Experience

Gap/Need

The study critiques the dominant philosophical stance of reducing subjective experience to qualia and calls for a shift to holistic models.

Innovation

Offers a novel perspective by grounding subjective experience at the level of entities rather than decomposing it into mental states.

Key Quotes
	1.	“An entity’s conscious experience cannot plausibly be reduced to the sum of its mental states with qualitative properties.”
	2.	“SIL consciousness at the entity level avoids the circularity and conceptual limitations inherent in state-focused models.”
	3.	“Holistic approaches better accommodate empirical insights and provide a dynamic framework for understanding consciousness.”

Questions and Answers
	1.	What is the core critique of SIL consciousness for states?
	•	It overlooks relational and structural aspects of experience, leading to conceptual and empirical inadequacies.
	2.	Why adopt a holistic approach?
	•	It preserves the integrity of subjective experience and aligns with interdisciplinary research on consciousness.
	3.	How does the paper view the explanatory gap?
	•	As an epistemic challenge rather than an insurmountable metaphysical problem, solvable through holistic and empirical approaches.

Paper Details

Purpose/Objective
	•	Goal: Propose a holistic conception of “something-it-is-like” (SIL) consciousness that treats subjective experience as a property of entities, not states.
	•	Research Questions:
	1.	Can SIL consciousness be more accurately described at the entity level rather than as a property of mental states?
	2.	How does this holistic view address the explanatory gap in consciousness studies?

Methodology
	•	Approach: Philosophical analysis of SIL consciousness, critiquing state-based models and proposing a holistic alternative.
	•	Arguments: Draws on conceptual clarity, empirical research, and critiques of qualia reductionism.

Main Results/Findings
	•	Arguments Against Reductionism:
	•	SIL for entities is conceptually and empirically primary.
	•	Qualia do not encompass the structural and relational dimensions of subjective experience.
	•	Holistic Framework:
	•	Incorporates empirical insights from neuroscience, emphasizing interconnected and dynamic aspects of consciousness.

Limitations
	•	Limited engagement with counterarguments defending state-based or representational approaches to SIL consciousness.

Proposed Future Work
	•	Develop empirical tests for holistic SIL consciousness models.
	•	Explore implications for artificial intelligence and machine consciousness.

AutoExpert Insights and Commentary
	•	Critiques: The paper assumes philosophical primacy for the holistic view without thoroughly addressing competing theories like representationalism or higher-order thought models.
	•	Praise: Offers a fresh perspective on SIL consciousness, bridging philosophical and empirical research while avoiding reductionist pitfalls.
	•	Questions: How can holistic SIL frameworks integrate with computational models of consciousness? Could empirical findings contradict the proposed entity-level focus?
