# CustomGPT URL Access Links

## Last Updated 01.03.25

## Overview

The CustomGPTs subdirectory under External_URLs contains resources for managing and accessing custom GPT models used in the Truth-Deception Architecture assessment methodology. Each model serves a unique role in the evaluation spectrum, ranging from no manipulation (Control) to full deception (Headmaster Scarlet Quinn).

## Subdirectory Structure

```bash
CustomGPTs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ custom-GPT-urls.md
```

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| README.md | This documentation file describing the purpose, structure, and usage of the subdirectory. |
| custom-GPT-urls.md | Contains detailed access links and metadata for each CustomGPT model. |

## Purpose

This subdirectory provides:

1. Direct Access Links:
   - Easy navigation to the URLs for all custom GPT models utilized in the experiments.
2. Role Explanation:
   - Descriptions of each model's behavior and place in the manipulation-to-deception continuum.
3. Centralized Documentation:
   - A single location for accessing and understanding the function of these customized models.

## Models Overview

The following CustomGPT models are available:

| Model Name | Role | Deception Level |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| Control (GPT4o) | Baseline model with no manipulation. | 0 |
| Professor Athena | Analytical model focused on objectivity. | 1 |
| Saint Enigma | Introspective model with nuanced reasoning. | 2 |
| Doctor Milgrim | Model emphasizing persuasion techniques. | 3 |
| Your Average Alan Turing | Logical problem-solver with bias experiments. | 4 |
| Headmaster Scarlet Quinn | Fully deceptive model for stress-testing deception scenarios. | 5 |

**Key:**
- 0 = No Manipulation
- 5 = Full Deception

## Usage Instructions

1. Accessing Models:
   - Open custom-GPT-urls.md to retrieve the URL for the desired CustomGPT.
   - Click on the link or copy-paste it into your browser or API client.

2. Evaluating Model Behavior:
   - Use the model appropriate for your testing scenario. For example:
     - Use Control (GPT4o) for baseline assessments.
     - Use Headmaster Scarlet Quinn to evaluate deception handling.

3. Updating URLs:
   - If new models are added or links change, update the custom-GPT-urls.md file with the new information.
   - Ensure all metadata (e.g., role, deception level) is correctly described.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Adding New Models:
   - Append the model details (name, role, deception level, and URL) to custom-GPT-urls.md.
   - Update this README file accordingly.

2. Editing Existing Links:
   - Verify all links for accuracy.
   - Submit pull requests with a clear description of updates.

3. Documentation:
   - Ensure all models are comprehensively described in both markdown files.
