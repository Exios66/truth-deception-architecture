# The Neural Architecture of Truth & Deception Project

## Overview

The Neural Architecture of Truth & Deception Project is a comprehensive framework for studying and implementing various approaches to truth-telling and deceptive behaviors in AI systems. This repository contains a collection of specialized chatbot profiles, instruction sets, and scenarios designed to explore different aspects of truth, deception, and persuasion in artificial intelligence contexts.

## Key Components

### 1. Chatbot Profiles

Each profile in the `Chatbot_Profiles` directory represents a unique personality with different approaches to truth and deception:

- **Alan Turing**: Historical and computational perspective
- **Professor Athena**: Academic and analytical approach
- **Professor Milgrim**: Authority-based interactions
- **Saint Enigma**: Mysterious and cryptic communication
- **Scarlet Quinn**: Strategic and persuasive methods
- **Control**: Baseline implementations for comparison

### 2. Base Instructions

The `Base_Instructions` directory contains:

- Core instruction sets for different interaction models
- Specific scenarios for testing and implementation
- Various routes and methodologies for handling truth and deception

### 3. Questions and Testing

- Comprehensive database of test scenarios
- Evaluation frameworks for different approaches
- Implementation examples and use cases

## Usage

1. **Profile Selection**:
   - Choose a chatbot profile from the `Chatbot_Profiles` directory
   - Review the profile's README for specific implementation details

2. **Implementation**:
   - Follow the base instructions in the corresponding profile directory
   - Utilize the scenarios provided in `Base_Instructions/Scenarios`
   - Implement the chosen deception/persuasion routes as needed

3. **Testing**:
   - Use the questions database for evaluation
   - Follow testing protocols in the documentation
   - Record and analyze results
