# The Neural Architecture of Truth & Deception Project

## Overview

The Neural Architecture of Truth & Deception Project is an exploration into the cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying truth-telling and deceptive behaviors. This repository aims to model and analyze the neural and psychological processes involved in deception, providing insights that can be applied in various fields such as artificial intelligence, psychology, and neuroscience.

## Features

- **Cognitive Modeling**: Simulates neural processes associated with truth and deception.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Tools for analyzing patterns in deceptive behaviors.
- **Data Integration**: Incorporates psychological and neural data for comprehensive modeling.
- **Custom GPT Implementations**: Utilizes custom GPT models to study language patterns in deception.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Exios66/truth-deception-architecture.git
   cd truth-deception-architecture

	2.	Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install dependencies:
Ensure you have pip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Note: If requirements.txt is not present, please refer to the project’s documentation for dependency information.
