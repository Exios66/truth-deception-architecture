## Abstract & Background

Background: ChatGPT is a conversational large language model that has the potential to revolutionize knowledge acquisition.
However, the impact of this technology on the quality of education is still unknown considering the risks and concerns surrounding
ChatGPT use. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the usability and acceptability of this promising tool. As an innovative technology,
the intention to use ChatGPT can be studied in the context of the technology acceptance model (TAM).
Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a TAM-based survey instrument called TAME-ChatGPT (Technology
Acceptance Model Edited to Assess ChatGPT Adoption) that could be employed to examine the successful integration and use
of ChatGPT in health care education.
Methods: The survey tool was created based on the TAM framework. It comprised 13 items for participants who heard of
ChatGPT but did not use it and 23 items for participants who used ChatGPT. Using a convenient sampling approach, the survey
link was circulated electronically among university students between February and March 2023. Exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) was used to assess the construct validity of the survey instrument.
Results: The final sample comprised 458 respondents, the majority among them undergraduate students (n=442, 96.5%). Only
109 (23.8%) respondents had heard of ChatGPT prior to participation and only 55 (11.3%) self-reported ChatGPT use before the
study. EFA analysis on the attitude and usage scales showed significant Bartlett tests of sphericity scores (P<.001) and adequate
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measures (0.823 for the attitude scale and 0.702 for the usage scale), confirming the factorability of the
correlation matrices. The EFA showed that 3 constructs explained a cumulative total of 69.3% variance in the attitude scale, and
these subscales represented perceived risks, attitude to technology/social influence, and anxiety.
