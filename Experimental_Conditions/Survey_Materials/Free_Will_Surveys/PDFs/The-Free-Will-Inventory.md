## Abstract

In this paper, we present the results of the construction and validation of a new psycho-
metric tool for measuring beliefs about free will and related concepts: The Free Will Inven-
tory (FWI). In its final form, FWI is a 29-item instrument with two parts. Part 1 consists of
three 5-item subscales designed to measure strength of belief in free will, determinism,
and dualism. Part 2 consists of a series of fourteen statements designed to further explore
the complex network of peopleâ€™s associated beliefs and attitudes about free will, determin-
ism, choice, the soul, predictability, responsibility, and punishment. Having presented the
construction and validation of FWI, we discuss several ways that it could be used in future
research, highlight some as yet unanswered questions that are ripe for interdisciplinary
investigation, and encourage researchers to join us in our efforts to answer these questions.
