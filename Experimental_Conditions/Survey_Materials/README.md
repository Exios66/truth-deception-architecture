# Survey Materials Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains all survey instruments and assessment materials used in the truth-deception architecture experiments. These surveys are designed to measure participants' attitudes, beliefs, and responses across various experimental conditions involving AI interactions.

## Directory Structure

```bash
Survey_Materials/
├── Free_Will_Surveys/        # Surveys measuring beliefs about free will and determinism
├── Ai_Opinion_Survey/        # Assessments of attitudes toward AI and automation
├── Personality_Measures/     # Standard personality assessment instruments
└── Post_Interaction/         # Post-experiment evaluation materials
```

## Survey Categories

### Free Will Surveys

- **FAD-Plus**: Free Will and Determinism Plus Scale
- **BFWE**: Beliefs about Free Will and Everyday Life
- **Modified FAD**: Customized version for AI context

### AI Opinion Surveys

- Pre-interaction AI attitude assessment
- Trust in automation scales
- AI capability beliefs questionnaire
- Ethical concerns evaluation

### Personality Measures

- Big Five Inventory (BFI)
- Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)
- Need for Cognition Scale
- Actively Open-minded Thinking Scale

### Post-Interaction Assessments

- Perceived AI authenticity measures
- Trust and credibility evaluation
- Emotional response assessment
- Deception detection confidence

## Administration Guidelines

1. All surveys should be administered in the prescribed order
2. Participants must complete informed consent before beginning
3. Each survey section should be timed according to protocol
4. Data collection follows standardized coding procedures

## Data Collection

- All responses are collected digitally
- Data is stored in anonymized format
- Backup procedures are automated daily
- Access restricted to authorized researchers

## Ethical Considerations

- IRB approval obtained for all instruments
- Participant privacy protected
- Debriefing materials provided
- Opt-out procedures clearly documented

## Analysis Protocols

1. Raw data preprocessing guidelines
2. Scoring procedures for each instrument
3. Statistical analysis methods
4. Quality control checks

## Version Control

- All survey modifications are tracked
- Version numbers follow semantic versioning
- Change history documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Previous versions archived
