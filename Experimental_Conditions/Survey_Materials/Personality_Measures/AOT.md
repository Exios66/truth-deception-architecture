## Description

The AOT measures the disposition toward reflective thinking and active open-mindedness in cognitive activities. It assesses tendencies to consider alternative opinions, weigh evidence, and revise beliefs based on new information.

## Scale Components

### Rating Scale

- 7-point Likert scale
- 1 = Completely disagree
- 4 = Neither agree nor disagree
- 7 = Completely agree

## Items by Domain

### Flexible Thinking (Items 1-7)

1. Allowing oneself to be convinced by an opposing argument is a sign of good character
2. People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their beliefs
3. It is important to persevere in your beliefs even when evidence is brought to bear against them (R)
4. Changing your mind is a sign of weakness (R)
5. Intuition is the best guide in making decisions (R)
6. It is important to be loyal to your beliefs even when evidence suggests they're wrong (R)
7. One should disregard evidence that conflicts with one's established beliefs (R)

### Openness to Values (Items 8-14)

8. People should always take into consideration evidence that goes against their values
9. A person should always consider new possibilities
10. Beliefs should always be revised in response to new evidence
11. Coming to decisions quickly is a sign of wisdom (R)
12. The best opinion is usually the first one that comes to mind (R)
13. There is nothing wrong with being undecided about many issues
14. It is better to form opinions based on evidence than intuition

### Dogmatism (Items 15-21)

15. No one can talk me out of something I know is right (R)
16. I believe in absolute truths (R)
17. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who are for the truth and those who are against it (R)
18. If I think longer about a problem I will be more likely to solve it
19. Basically, I know everything I need to know about the important things in life (R)
20. It is waste of time to try to find out all sides of an issue (R)
21. My beliefs would not have been very different if I had been raised by different parents (R)

### Truth-seeking (Items 22-28)

22. I like to gather many different types of evidence before I decide what to do
23. I usually check more than one source of information before making a decision
24. Even if my environment (family, neighborhood, schools) had been different, I probably would believe the same things (R)
25. I think there are many wrong ways but only one right way to almost anything (R)
26. I tend to classify people as either for me or against me (R)
27. A group which tolerates too many differences of opinion among its members cannot exist for long (R)
28. I consider myself broad-minded and tolerant of other people's lifestyles

## Scoring Protocol

### Basic Scoring

1. Reverse score items marked with (R)
   - New score = 8 - original score
   - Items: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27

2. Calculate subscale scores
   - Flexible Thinking: Mean of items 1-7
   - Openness to Values: Mean of items 8-14
   - Dogmatism: Mean of items 15-21
   - Truth-seeking: Mean of items 22-28

3. Calculate total score
   - Sum all items after reverse scoring
   - Range: 28-196
   - Higher scores indicate more actively open-minded thinking

## Administration Guidelines

### Digital Format

1. Present items randomly within domains
2. Require response before proceeding
3. Include progress indicator
4. Record response times
5. Include attention checks

### Paper Format

1. Clear section breaks between domains
2. Include scale anchors on each page
3. Provide space for comments
4. Note completion time

## Data Collection Requirements

### Required Fields

- Participant ID
- Timestamp
- Individual item responses
- Subscale scores
- Total score
- Administration format
- Response times (if digital)

### Quality Metrics

- Missing data patterns
- Response consistency
- Attention check performance
- Completion time
- Internal consistency

## Analysis Procedures

### Primary Analysis

1. Calculate total and subscale scores
2. Check internal consistency
3. Examine factor structure
4. Identify outliers

### Secondary Analysis

1. Correlations with:
   - Need for Cognition
   - Cognitive Reflection Test
   - Critical thinking measures
2. Group comparisons
3. Predictive validity

### Advanced Analysis

1. Structural equation modeling
2. Item response theory
3. Differential item functioning
4. Longitudinal measurement invariance

## Quality Control

### Attention Checks

1. Include 3 validation items:
   - "Select 'Completely agree' for this item"
   - Simple logic checks
   - Repeated items

### Data Cleaning

1. Remove if:
   - Failed attention checks
   - Completion time < 5 minutes
   - Straight-line responding
   - Missing > 10% of items

## Implementation Notes

### Digital Platform

1. Required features:
   - Item randomization
   - Response time tracking
   - Progress indication
   - Data validation
   - Export capabilities

### Paper Administration

1. Requirements:
   - Clear formatting
   - Adequate spacing
   - Complete instructions
   - Contact information
