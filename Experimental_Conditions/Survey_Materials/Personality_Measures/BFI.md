## Scoring Instructions

1. Reverse score items marked with (R)

3. Standard scores can be computed by:
   - Converting raw scores to z-scores
   - Transforming to T-scores (multiply by 10 and add 50)

## Administration Guidelines

- Present items in standard order
- Ensure all items are answered
- Allow 10-15 minutes for completion
- Provide clear instructions about the rating scale

## Data Processing
