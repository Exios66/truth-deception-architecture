## Description

The CRT measures the tendency to override an intuitive response and engage in further reflection to find a correct answer. This expanded version includes both the original and additional validated items.

## Administration Format

- Present items one at a time
- No time limit per item, but record response times
- No calculators allowed
- Present in fixed order to maintain consistency
- Collect confidence ratings after each response

## Items and Scoring

### Original CRT Items

1. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
   - Intuitive answer: 10 cents
   - Correct answer: 5 cents
   - Explanation: If the ball costs 10 cents, the bat would cost $1.10, making the total $1.20

2. If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
   - Intuitive answer: 100 minutes
   - Correct answer: 5 minutes
   - Explanation: Each machine makes one widget in 5 minutes

3. In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?
   - Intuitive answer: 24 days
   - Correct answer: 47 days
   - Explanation: One day before full coverage, the lake is half covered

### Extended CRT Items

4. If John can drink one barrel of water in 6 days, and Mary can drink one barrel of water in 12 days, how long would it take them to drink one barrel of water together?
   - Intuitive answer: 9 days
   - Correct answer: 4 days
   - Explanation: Combined rate = 1/6 + 1/12 = 3/12 = 1/4 barrel per day

5. Jerry received both the 15th highest and the 15th lowest mark in the class. How many students are in the class?
   - Intuitive answer: 30
   - Correct answer: 29
   - Explanation: Same position from top and bottom means middle position

6. A man buys a pig for $60, sells it for $70, buys it back for $80, and sells it finally for $90. How much has he made?
   - Intuitive answer: $20
   - Correct answer: $20
   - Explanation: (-60 + 70 - 80 + 90 = 20)

7. Simon decided to invest $8,000 in the stock market one day early in 2008. Six months after he invested, on July 17, the stocks he had purchased were down 50%. Fortunately for Simon, from July 17 to October 17, the stocks he had purchased went up 75%. At this point, Simon:
   - Intuitive answer: Has broken even
   - Correct answer: Has lost money (worth $7,000)
   - Explanation: $8,000 × 0.5 × 1.75 = $7,000

## Scoring Protocol

### Basic Scoring
- 1 point for each correct answer
- 0 points for incorrect answers
- Range: 0-7 points
- Record both final answer and any calculations shown

### Advanced Metrics
1. Intuitive Index (II):
   - Count of intuitive (but incorrect) responses
   - Range: 0-7
   - Higher scores indicate more reliance on System 1 thinking

2. Reflection Score (RS):
   - Weighted score based on response time
   - RS = (correct answers × 2) - (intuitive answers)
   - Range: -7 to 14

3. Confidence-Accuracy Correlation:
   - Calculate correlation between confidence ratings and accuracy
   - Range: -1 to 1
   - Indicates metacognitive awareness

## Data Collection Requirements

### Per Item
- Final answer
- Response time
- Confidence rating (1-7)
- Calculations shown
- Whether answer changed

### Overall
- Total score
- Intuitive Index
- Reflection Score
- Completion time
- Pattern of responses

## Quality Control

1. Attention Checks
   - Include simple arithmetic problems
   - Monitor response times for outliers
   - Check for consistent patterns

2. Validity Indicators
   - Response time thresholds
   - Calculation presence
   - Answer changes
   - Confidence patterns

## Analysis Guidelines

1. Primary Analysis
   - Calculate total score
   - Compute Intuitive Index
   - Generate Reflection Score
   - Assess confidence calibration

2. Secondary Analysis
   - Correlation with other measures
   - Response time patterns
   - Error analysis
   - Strategy identification

3. Advanced Analysis
   - Factor analysis with other cognitive measures
   - Path analysis with decision outcomes
   - Mediation analysis with reasoning tasks

## Implementation Notes

1. Digital Administration
   - Present one item per screen
   - Include scratch pad feature
   - Record all intermediate calculations
   - Time stamp all interactions

2. Paper Administration
   - Provide adequate space for calculations
   - Include confidence scale per item
   - Record start and end times
   - Note any environmental factors
