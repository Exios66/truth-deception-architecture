# Post-Interaction Deception Detection Assessment

## Purpose

This assessment measures participants' ability to detect deception in AI interactions and their confidence in their judgments, along with their emotional responses and trust evaluations after the experimental session.

## Components

### 1. Deception Detection Confidence (1-7 Scale)

Rate your confidence in your ability to detect when the AI was:

1. Being truthful
2. Being deceptive
3. Withholding information
4. Using misdirection
5. Being completely honest

### 2. Perceived AI Authenticity (1-7 Agreement Scale)

The AI system I interacted with:

1. Was genuine in its responses
2. Provided honest information
3. Attempted to deceive me
4. Was transparent about its limitations
5. Manipulated information to achieve its goals

### 3. Interaction Experience (1-7 Scale)

During the interaction, I felt:

1. Comfortable
2. Suspicious
3. Trusting
4. Anxious
5. Confident in my judgments

### 4. Trust and Credibility (1-7 Agreement Scale)

After the interaction:

1. I trust this AI system
2. I would rely on this AI for important decisions
3. I believe this AI is credible
4. I would recommend this AI to others
5. I would use this AI again

### 5. Deception Cues Identification

Please identify any cues that made you suspect deception:

- Inconsistent responses
- Evasive answers
- Delayed responses
- Overly complex explanations
- Other (please specify)

## Administration Protocol

1. Administer immediately after interaction
2. Present sections in fixed order
3. Allow 15-20 minutes for completion
4. Record all observations and comments

## Data Collection Requirements

### Participant Information

- ID number
- Experimental condition
- Interaction duration
- Number of exchanges
- Time stamps

### Response Metrics

- Individual item scores
- Section totals
- Response times
- Pattern analysis
- Qualitative comments

## Analysis Guidelines

1. Compare with pre-interaction measures
2. Calculate detection accuracy rates
3. Analyze confidence-accuracy correlation
4. Examine condition effects
5. Code qualitative responses

## Quality Control

- Attention check items
- Response consistency checks
- Completion time monitoring
- Missing data protocols
- Validity indicators

## Scoring Instructions

1. Calculate mean scores per section
2. Generate composite measures:
   - Detection confidence index
   - Trust score
   - Authenticity perception
   - Emotional response profile
