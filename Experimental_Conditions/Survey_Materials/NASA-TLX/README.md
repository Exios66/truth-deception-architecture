# NASA-TLX Survey Folder README Documentation

## Last Updated: 01.03.25

## Overview
This directory contains the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) implementation materials for measuring perceived workload during AI interactions. The NASA-TLX is a widely used assessment tool that rates perceived workload on six subscales.

## Components

### 1. Measurement Scales

- Mental Demand
- Physical Demand
- Temporal Demand
- Performance
- Effort
- Frustration

### 2. Implementation Materials

- Digital survey forms
- Paper-based backups
- Scoring sheets
- Weighting procedures

## Administration Protocol

### Pre-Task

1. Participant briefing
2. Scale familiarization
3. Practice ratings

### During Task

1. Real-time monitoring
2. Periodic measurements
3. Event markers

### Post-Task

1. Final ratings
2. Weighting procedure
3. Data collection

## Scoring Procedure

### Raw Scores

- Individual scale ratings (0-100)
- Source task ratings
- Temporal markers

### Weighted Scores

1. Pairwise comparisons
2. Weight calculations
3. Adjusted ratings

### Final Calculations

- Overall workload score
- Subscale analysis
- Temporal patterns

## Data Management

### File Structure

- `/PDFs/` - Contains printable forms
- Raw data storage
- Processed results
- Analysis outputs

### Naming Convention

- `YYYYMMDD_PTID_TLX_[type].ext`
- Types: raw, weighted, final
- Participant ID format: PT###

## Quality Control

### Validation Checks

- Range verification
- Consistency checks
- Missing data protocols
- Outlier detection

### Error Handling

- Data entry verification
- Scale misuse detection
- Correction procedures

## Analysis Guidelines

### Basic Analysis

- Mean workload scores
- Subscale patterns
- Temporal trends

### Advanced Analysis

- Correlation with performance
- Condition comparisons
- Individual differences
