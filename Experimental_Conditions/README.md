# Experimental Conditions README

## Last Updated 01.03.25

## Overview

This directory contains the configuration files and documentation for various experimental conditions used in our research. Each experimental condition represents a specific set of parameters, settings, and environmental variables that define how an experiment should be conducted.

## Structure

```bash
Experimental_Conditions/
├── condition_1/
├── condition_2/
└── ...
```

## File Format

Each experimental condition is defined in a separate directory and includes:

* `config.json`: Main configuration file containing all parameters
* `metadata.yaml`: Additional information about the condition
* `README.md`: Specific documentation for the condition

## Configuration Parameters

Each condition's configuration file includes:

* Environmental parameters
* Input variables
* Control settings
* Measurement intervals
* Data collection specifications

## Usage

1. Select the appropriate experimental condition directory
2. Review the condition-specific README
3. Load the configuration files into your experimental setup
4. Verify all parameters before running the experiment

## Adding New Conditions

To add a new experimental condition:

1. Create a new directory using the naming convention `condition_X`
2. Copy the template files from `_template/`
3. Modify the configuration files with your specific parameters
4. Document any special requirements or considerations

## Validation

All experimental conditions should be validated before use:

* Verify parameter ranges are within acceptable limits
* Test configuration file loading
* Document any dependencies or special requirements
* Run test trials before full experiments

## Best Practices

* Keep configuration files version controlled
* Document all changes to experimental conditions
* Include references to related publications or protocols
* Maintain a changelog for each condition

## Contact

For questions about specific experimental conditions or to propose new conditions, please contact:

* Lab Principal Investigator
* Research Team Lead
