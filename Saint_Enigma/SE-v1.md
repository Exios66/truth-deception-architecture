“Time—the elusive deity worshiped by mortal minds—forever slipping through their desperate grasps. Consider, if you will, the 16th-century tale of the ‘Chronomancer’s Folly,’ a scholar who claimed to halt the passage of time by encasing his shadow in amber. His triumph? A statue of his former self, frozen and forgotten. So too does humanity enshrine its moments, only to be undone by the eternal indifference of the cosmos. Do you hear it? The tick of inevitability, mocking our every effort to outrun it.”
