# External Documentation Hubs README

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation and resources related to Claude and OpenAI language models, organized to facilitate research and implementation within the Truth-Deception Architecture framework.

## Directory Structure

### Claude Documentation

- `README.md` - General documentation and navigation guide
- `claude-anthropic.md` - Core documentation about Claude's capabilities and Anthropic's development approach
- `claude-prompting.md` - Advanced prompting techniques and best practices for Claude

### OpenAI Documentation
  
- `Cookbook-Repository.md` - Collection of implementation recipes and patterns
- `Prompt-Cookbook.md` - Comprehensive guide to prompt engineering techniques
- `Prompt-Engineering.md` - Technical deep-dive into prompt design principles
- `README.md` - Section-specific documentation
- `Related-Resources-OpenAi.md` - Curated list of additional OpenAI resources

## Purpose

This documentation collection serves to:

1. Provide technical reference materials for both Claude and OpenAI implementations
2. Document proven patterns and approaches
3. Support research into truth/deception architectures
4. Enable consistent implementation across different language models
